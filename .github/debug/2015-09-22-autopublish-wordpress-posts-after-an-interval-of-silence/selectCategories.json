Analysiere den Newstext.\n2. Wähle alle passenden Kategorien.\n3. Vergib für jede gewählte Kategorie eine Relevanz von 1 bis 10 und begründe deine Einstufung in einem Satz.\n\nHier ist die Kategorien-Liste:\n- ai\n- programming\n- databases\n- security\n- work\n- data protection\n- copyright\n\nHier ist der Newstext:\n# Autopublish WordPress posts after an interval of silence\n\n\r\nHaving periodically posts without much effort is easy to reach with the WordPress API. I will describe here what's the use case and which solution I use.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## The problem of scheduled publishing\r\n\r\nWordPress already have a feature for automatic publish posts in the future. But scheduling has a great disadvantage: I must define the date manually in every post. If a new post is finished I must show when the last post will be published and schedule the finished days after that. If I want to publish spontaneously a post I have more posts in the time or must reschedule all posts with new dates.\r\n\r\n## Flexible periodically publishing\r\n\r\nBut what I want is:\r\n\r\n* I will write posts and if they are finished and can be published I want to add them into a pipeline or spontaneously publish\r\n* If I don't publish a post for days the next post in the pipeline should automatic published\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple reachable with the WordPress API. A script running per CronJob check the date of the last published post and publish the next in the pipeline if its needed. The pipeline are all posts with a specific status (e.g. \"pending\").\r\n\r\nThe CronScript for this is available on GitHub:\r\n[https://github.com/dragonprojects/wordpress-autopublish](https://github.com/dragonprojects/wordpress-autopublish)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nWith this simple CronScript its possible to write posts without thinking about the publishing and have always an up to date blog.\r\n\n    ",

That’s right, you can do that, as well as unpublish and republish posts when needed. It sounds helpful, right? Especially when you have a tight timetable yourself? WordPress has a schedule post tool that helps you regulate your content online. You can write your articles ahead of time and schedule them for a later date. You can even set a time to automatically unpublish a blog post.\n\nIn this article, we will look at how to use the built-in WordPress schedule tool available with the Gutenberg editor. The guide will also cover the PublishPress Future plugin, which will grant you the extra functionality to set the status of a published blog post. This is a useful feature not available in WordPress.\n\nTop 7 Reasons To Schedule Posts\n-------------------------------\n\nPublishing posts on your website regularly is essential for the popularity of your blog. Many website administrators prefer to schedule posts in WordPress because it has a lot of benefits.\n\n1.  It is a good media strategy that helps you stay on top of your schedule.\n2.  Using the WordPress calendar will save you a lot of time and help you stay organized with your uploading tasks.\n3.  Publishing your articles or posts at regular intervals will attract the audience to your site for more information.\n4.  When you schedule your content for the future, you don’t have to worry about publishing it at a specific time.\n5.  You can take a vacation and not worry about writing and publishing your posts for a while.\n6.  Scheduling your posts gives your website a fresh look whenever they upload without requiring your presence online.\n7.  You can time your posts to go online automatically at a time when web traffic is on the rise. Traffic time will increase the viewing rate of your posts. You don’t have to go through the trouble of posting during a high-traffic period.\n\nHow Do I Schedule Posts in WordPress?\n-------------------------------------\n\nPublishing on WordPress is easy. Unfortunately, scheduling it is not straightforward. It is not a difficult task. You only need to perform a few steps. However, the “Schedule“ button is not visible in the WordPress post. Due to this, many are unaware of the WordPress post scheduler function.\n\nBefore diving into how to schedule posts in WordPress, let’s look at the different types of post statuses WordPress supports. It is important to know the different types of status because you never know when one of these options may prove useful. Also, if you prefer to use a plugin, more flexibility and features for scheduling posts in WordPress may become available. So, having knowledge on hand is always beneficial.\n\n*   Publish: Status viewable by everyone. \n*   Future: posts that are viewable at a future date.\n*   Pending review: for a user who has publish authority.\n*   Draft: incomplete posts, that are viewable by the users, and do not have a publishing",

You don’t need to manually publish each blog post. Rather, you set a publish time and your posts would automatically be live. It makes publishing a lot convenient.\n\n### Why you should schedule your blog posts\n\nBefore you learn how to schedule blog posts, here are some reasons to help you understand how auto-publishing and scheduling could be useful.\n\n1.  **Publishing consistency**  \n    If you follow a strict publishing timeline on your blog, say weekly or monthly, then scheduling can help you set a time for all the posts at once. Your audience will receive all your scheduled posts at the perfect time. That’s it.\n2.  **Time-zone and audience priority**  \n    If your audience is from a region that’s different than yours, then it might not receive your updates at the ideal time, so you might miss out some of their attention. Scheduling can help you encounter this problem by publishing your posts right when your audience is online.\n3.  **Batching for future**  \n    If you won’t be able to manage your blog for a certain period due to a vacation, internet problems or any other interruption, then your blog might lose consistency. However, keeping a few posts scheduled in advance can save the day for you.\n\nOverall, you can make scheduling work for you depending on your blogging calendar, audience, etc. and [automate the publishing process](https://www.blogtyrant.com/best-marketing-automation-tools/).\n\n### How to schedule your blog posts\n\nIf you’ve decided that you want to schedule your blog posts or want to see how it works, then follow the next steps to do it. Consider that you already have a publish-ready post in your drafts and you want to schedule it for auto-publishing.\n\nFirstly, find the _Publish_ section and see that the default option is ‘publish immediately.’ You need to change that for scheduling your post.\n\nNear the _Publish immediately_ option _>_ click on _edit_. This would make the month, date, year and time options appear.\n\nAfter this you can change the date and time to your preferred publishing time and click _OK >_ followed by _Publish_, after which your post will be published at the scheduled time.\n\nYou’re done.\n\nYou’ll see a notification on your screen telling you when your post will be published.\n\n### Some quick tips\n\nNow that you know how to schedule your blog posts, here are a few other tips you should take a note of.\n\n*   **Backdating**  \n    You can backdate your existing blog post thorough calendar, for archive appearance and other purposes.\n*   **Republishing**  \n    You can republish you old blog posts by changing their status from _",
