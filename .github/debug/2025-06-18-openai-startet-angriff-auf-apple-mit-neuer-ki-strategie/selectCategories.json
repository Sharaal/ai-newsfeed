Ziel ist es, ein Gerät zu schaffen, das die Art und Weise, wie Menschen mit Technologie interagieren, grundlegend verändert. Diese Ankündigung kommt zu einem Zeitpunkt, an dem Apple selbst unter Druck steht, seine KI-Strategie zu überdenken, um mit Konkurrenten wie Google und OpenAI Schritt zu halten.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nDie Zusammenarbeit zwischen OpenAI und Ive, der für ikonische Apple-Produkte wie das iPhone und den iMac verantwortlich war, könnte Apple direkt herausfordern. OpenAI hat bereits die Designfirma von Ive, LoveFrom, für 6,5 Milliarden Dollar übernommen, um die Entwicklung voranzutreiben. Insider berichten, dass das geplante Gerät eine Kombination aus Sprachsteuerung, Augmented Reality und KI sein könnte – ein potenzieller Gamechanger, der Apples Dominanz im Hardwaremarkt gefährden könnte.\n\nWährend OpenAI mit dieser Initiative in den Hardwaremarkt einsteigt, hat Apple kürzlich auf seiner WWDC 2025 neue KI-Funktionen für Siri und iOS 19 vorgestellt. Doch Kritiker bemängeln, dass diese Neuerungen hinter den Innovationen von OpenAI und anderen Wettbewerbern zurückbleiben. Apples Fokus auf Datenschutz und On-Device-Verarbeitung wird zwar gelobt, doch die fehlende Integration von generativer KI könnte langfristig ein Nachteil sein.\n\nDie Rivalität zwischen OpenAI und Apple spiegelt eine größere Dynamik im Tech-Sektor wider, in der KI zunehmend zum entscheidenden Faktor wird. Ob OpenAI mit seiner neuen Hardware tatsächlich Apples Marktanteile angreifen kann, bleibt abzuwarten. Klar ist jedoch, dass die kommenden Monate entscheidend für die Zukunft beider Unternehmen sein werden.\n\n### Quellen\n- [ZDFheute: OpenAI plant neues Gerät mit Jony Ive](https://www.zdfheute.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/apple-intelligence-ki-chatgpt-openai-100.html)\n- [Tagesschau: OpenAI und Jony Ive – eine neue Ära?](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/technologie/openai-ki-design-ive-apple-100.html)\n- [IT-Boltwise: Apples WWDC 2025 und die KI-Strategie](https://www.it-boltwise.de/apples-wwdc-2025-neue-betriebssysteme-und-ki-strategien-im-fokus.html)\n\n    ",

Given the pair’s emphasis on building a hardware device for the AI era, and Ive’s pedigree at Apple, it’s likely a consumer-facing product.\n\nIo launched last spring as part of a joint project between OpenAI and Ive’s design firm LoveFrom. In the fourth quarter of last year, Io and OpenAI entered into an official agreement for OpenAI to receive a 23 percent stake in Io. Now OpenAI is buying the entity outright.\n\nThe merger is a slightly complicated one. The Io team was made up of 55 people prior to this announcement. Now it will expand to include both Io and OpenAI employees—hardware and software engineers, physicists, scientists, and “experts in product development and manufacturing,” according to a blog post on OpenAI’s website. Ive and Lovefrom will manage the creative design process. But Ive will remain independent, OpenAI says, and his firm LoveFrom will continue to operate as a separate entity. The Io team will instead report to Peter Welinder, OpenAI’s vice president of product, who has worked at OpenAI for eight and a half years.\n\nIo’s founding team has major design chops. Beyond Ive, the founders include Evans Hankey and Tang Tan, who both worked at Apple. Those who've worked closely with them say they're known to hire people whom they believe have exceptional taste.\n\nBy bringing on Ive, OpenAI is officially embarking on what is likely one of the most ambitious AI hardware project to date. A number of other major tech companies, including Meta and Google, have tried developing AI-powered devices [such as smart glasses](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-smar",

Announced on May 21, 2025, this $6.5 billion deal involves OpenAI acquiring Ive’s AI hardware startup, io, in an all-stock transaction, marking the company’s largest acquisition. This partnership aims to blend OpenAI’s cutting-edge AI capabilities with Ive’s unparalleled design expertise to create a new generation of AI-powered devices. Here’s a detailed look at this collaboration, its objectives, and what it means for the future of technology.\n\n**The Genesis of the Partnership**\n\nThe collaboration between OpenAI and Jony Ive began two years ago, rooted in a shared vision to reimagine how people interact with technology. According to a joint statement by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive, their partnership evolved from “friendship, curiosity, and shared values” into a bold ambition to create a new family of AI-driven products. The idea for io, founded by Ive and other Apple alumni in 2024, emerged from this collaboration to develop hardware that seamlessly integrates with OpenAI’s generative AI technologies.\n\nIve, who spent 27 years at Apple shaping its design philosophy, left in 2019 to found LoveFrom, a creative collective working with brands like Airbnb and Ferrari. Through LoveFrom, Ive quietly collaborated with OpenAI, laying the groundwork for io, a startup focused on engineering and manufacturing AI-powered devices. The acquisition of io brings Ive’s team of approximately 55 engineers and researchers, including former Apple design leaders like Scott Cannon, Tang Tan, and Evans Hankey, into OpenAI’s fold, with Ive and LoveFrom assuming creative and design oversight across OpenAI’s products, including software and hardware.\n\n**The Objective: A New Era of AI Hardware**\n\nThe primary objective of this partnership is to create a “new family of products” that redefines how users engage with AI. In a promotional video, Ive and Altman emphasized that existing devices like smartphones and laptops are “decades old” and not optimized for AI’s capabilities. They aim to develop devices that make AI interactions more intuitive, less socially disruptive, and deeply integrated into daily life. While specifics about the devices remain concealed, Altman has hinted at a “crazy, ambitious thing” that could be “the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen.”\n\nSpeculation suggests the first product may be a screenless, phone-like device with advanced AI capabilities, distinct from traditional smartphones or smart glasses. This aligns with Ive’s skepticism about wearable devices and a focus on unobtrusive hardware that prioritizes user experience. The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI plans to produce 100 million AI “companions",

Recent legal documents have blown the lid off OpenAI's closely guarded hardware ambitions, revealing unprecedented details about their collaboration with design legend Jony Ive. These court filings expose OpenAI AI device plans that could fundamentally reshape how we interact with artificial intelligence technology. What started as a trademark dispute has become a treasure trove of insider information about one of tech's most anticipated products.\n\nThe revelations come at a critical moment when every major tech company is racing to create the next generation of AI-powered devices. While competitors fumble with incremental improvements, OpenAI and Ive's startup io appear to be crafting something entirely different. The OpenAI io AI device legal documents paint a picture of methodical research, ambitious vision, and strategic positioning that goes far beyond anything we've seen before.\n\nCourt Filings Expose OpenAI and io's AI Device Development Strategy\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### The Trademark Lawsuit That Unveiled OpenAI's Hardware Ambitions\n\nThe story begins with an unexpected legal clash that nobody saw coming. A Google-backed startup called iyO, which develops custom-molded earpieces, filed a trademark dispute lawsuit that inadvertently forced OpenAI to reveal its most guarded secrets. The irony is palpable – a company trying to protect its own intellectual property ended up exposing the AI giant's revolutionary hardware plans.\n\niyO's lawsuit centers on trademark infringement allegations related to OpenAI's partnership with Jony Ive's io startup. The legal proceedings took an interesting turn when a court order forced OpenAI to pull promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive's company. This wasn't just a minor legal hiccup – it was a seismic event that cracked open OpenAI's carefully constructed secrecy around their hardware ambitions.\n\nThe timing couldn't be more significant for the AI hardware race. Companies like Meta, Apple, and Google have been pouring billions into smart glasses, AR headsets, and AI-enabled wearables. But the OpenAI io AI device legal documents suggest something far more ambitious is brewing behind closed doors. The court filings reveal a level of strategic thinking and resource allocation that indicates OpenAI isn't just dabbling in hardware – they're preparing to dominate it.\n\n### OpenAI's Extensive Market R",

Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to communicate with features like Live Translation; do more with what’s on their screen with updates to visual intelligence; and express themselves with enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji.1 Additionally, Shortcuts can now tap into Apple Intelligence directly, and developers will be able to access the on-device large language model at the core of Apple Intelligence, giving them direct access to intelligence that is powerful, fast, built with privacy, and available even when users are offline. These Apple Intelligence features are available for testing starting today, and will be available to users with supported devices set to a supported language this fall.\n\n“Last year, we took the first steps on a journey to bring users intelligence that’s helpful, relevant, easy to use, and right where users need it, all while protecting their privacy. Now, the models that power Apple Intelligence are becoming more capable and efficient, and we’re integrating features in even more places across each of our operating systems,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We’re also taking the huge step of giving developers direct access to the on-device foundation model powering Apple Intelligence, allowing them to tap into intelligence that is powerful, fast, built with privacy, and available even when users are offline. We think this will ignite a whole new wave of intelligent experiences in the apps users rely on every day. We can’t wait to see what developers create.”\n\nApple Intelligence features will be coming to eight more languages by the end of the year: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional), and Vietnamese.\n\n**Live Translation Breaks Down Language Barriers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those moments when a language barrier gets in the way, Live Translation can help users communicate across languages when messaging or speaking. The experience is integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and Phone, and enabled by Apple-built models that run entirely on device, so users’ personal conversations stay personal.\n\nIn Messages, Live Translation can automatically translate messages. If a user is making plans with new friends while traveling abroad, their message can be translated as they type, delivered in the recipient’s preferred language, and when they get a response, each message can be instantly translated.2 On FaceTime calls, a user can follow along with translated live captions while still hearing the speaker’s voice. And when on a phone call, the translation is spoken aloud throughout the conversation.3\n\n*   [Live Translation in the Messages app displayed on iPhone 16 Pro.](#gallery-2258a90af77baff3ae800c01fde32a7d)\n*   [Live Translation with FaceTime displayed on iPhone 16 Pro.](#gallery-833c69a499be559d1c2836f700a6cf3c)\n*   [Live Translation during a phone call displayed on iPhone 16 Pro.](#gallery-348d9477c804d1b02234c69c4b569de1)\n\n \n\nWith Live Translation, users can communicate across languages whether they’re typing in Messages, or speaking during FaceTime or Phone conversations.\n\n[](/newsroom/images/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/article/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-A",

Reuters noted that Apple Intelligence, promised in 2024, faced delays, leaving users waiting for Siri’s conversational AI. The Verge highlighted CarPlay Ultra’s limited debut in Aston Martin vehicles, underscoring the pitfalls of early Apple feature announcements. Now, Apple is recalibrating. Features like iOS 19’s translucent interface or macOS 16’s productivity tools will likely emerge only when polished. TechCrunch emphasized that complex innovations, such as [Synchron’s Stentrode implant](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/synchron-nvidia-showcase-ai-brain-computer-interfaces) for brain-signal control, require extensive testing, making delayed announcements a necessity for reliability.\n\n[](https://applemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro.jpg)\n\niPhone 16 Pro\n\nWhy Apple Feature Announcements Shape Expectations\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[Apple feature announcements](https://applemagazine.com/apples-upcoming-products-and-announcements-for-the-year/) drive user decisions, from upgrading iPhones to exploring new apps. Early teasers, while exciting, risk eroding trust when delayed. Bloomberg reported that Siri’s 2024 AI overhaul fell short, with key features pushed to 2025, frustrating users as Google and Amazon’s assistants advanced. By refining Apple feature announcements, Apple ensures [WWDC 2025](https://applemagazine.com/apple-developer-app-gets-ready-for-wwdc-2025/) delivers usable updates, like iOS 19’s AI-enhanced Photos app or macOS 16’s streamlined workflows. The Verge noted CarPlay Ultra’s staggered rollout disappointed early adopters, but syncing Apple feature announcements with availability could stabilize Apple’s ecosystem, ensuring seamless iPhone, Mac, and iCloud experiences.\n\nThe Tradeoffs of Restraint\n--------------------------\n\nThis cautious approach has risks. Apple feature announcements fuel fan excitement, and fewer previews could reduce WWDC’s buzz. TechCrunch observed that Samsung often announces features early to dominate attention, even if delivery lags. Apple’s restraint might cede ground in AI or augmented reality, where hype drives perception. Development hurdles also persist—Reuters reported that [iOS 19’s aesthetic overhaul](https://applemagazine.com/apples-ios-19-overhaul/) challenges software teams balancing innovation and stability. Yet, prioritizing polished Apple feature announcements aligns with user demands for dependable tech, ensuring updates like Stentrode’s accessibility tools deliver without fail.\n\n[](https://app",

According to credible reports and early developer previews, this year’s update will introduce a redesigned interface, intelligent AI features, and enhanced multitasking capabilities. The update is expected to redefine how users interact with their iPhones and iPads—streamlining productivity, simplifying daily tasks, and unifying Apple’s ecosystem more than ever before.\n\nWhat to Expect from iOS 19 at WWDC 2025\n---------------------------------------\n\n**iOS 19** is shaping up to be one of Apple’s most transformative updates in recent memory. Building upon the foundation laid by iOS 18, which focused on personalization and privacy, this year’s version expands on core elements with a forward-thinking approach. Based on trusted leaks and analyst insights, users can anticipate:\n\n*   A modern design language with macOS-inspired visuals\n*   Advanced artificial intelligence tools across apps\n*   True multitasking enhancements for both iPad and iPhone\n*   Improved accessibility and productivity-focused features\n\nThe announcement will likely headline the WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9 and define the direction for all Apple software this year.\n\n### A Look Back: iOS Through the Years\n\nSince launching in 2007, iOS has continuously evolved to meet the changing demands of technology and users. From introducing the App Store to implementing screen time, privacy labels, and custom widgets, each iteration brought new value. iOS 18 brought ecosystem-wide personalization tools and privacy protections. With **iOS 19**, Apple seems focused on bringing AI and multitasking into the mainstream while refreshing the look and feel of iPhones and iPads.\n\n### Refined Design: Cleaner, Smarter, and More Consistent\n\nDesign changes in iOS 19 are expected to modernize the user interface while maintaining Apple’s signature simplicity. Influenced by macOS Sonoma, the visual overhaul may include:\n\n*   **Floating Navigation Elements:** More dynamic navigation within apps for easier access and less visual clutter\n*   **Interactive Widgets:** Not just static blocks—expect smarter widgets with live previews and deeper interactivity\n*   **Unified Visual Identity:** Closer design parity with macOS and iPadOS for consistency across Apple platforms\n\nOne Apple designer reportedly stated, “We want users to feel like they’re using something powerful, but never complicated.”\n\n### AI Features at the Core of iOS 19\n\nApple is expected to take a major leap forward in artificial intelligence with iOS 19. Building on the limited AI tools in iOS 18, the new version may introduce:\n\n*   **AI Suggestions in Native Apps:** Machine learning-driven replies and actions inside Messages, Mail, Calendar, and Notes\n*   **On-Device Generative Assistant:** A powerful new assistant rumored to go beyond Siri, capable of summarizing content, drafting emails, and managing tasks without sending data to the cloud\n*   **Third-Party AI Integration:** Support for Gemini, ChatGPT, or other models via Apple’s new developer tools\n\nApple has long prioritized privacy, and sources indicate all AI features will run on-device whenever possible to avoid compromising user data.\n\n### Multitasking Upgrades: True Productivity on Mobile\n\nMultitasking on iPad and iPhone is expected to receive a substantial upgrade. With iPads increasingly used as laptop alternatives, Apple will reportedly introduce:\n\n*   **Resizable App Windows:** Similar to Stage Manager, allowing flexible workspaces with multiple active apps\n*   **Gesture Controls:** Use intuitive swipes to switch, split, or stack windows quickly\n*   **Multiple Instances of the Same App:** A long-requested feature, useful for comparing documents or managing chats\n\nThese changes aim to reduce the need for external accessories or workarounds and make iPads more appealing to professional users.\n\n### Feedback from Developers and Users\n\nExcitement is build",
