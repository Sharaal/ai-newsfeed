So the `<script>` for JavaScript and the `<link>` for CSS won't work here.\r\n\r\nBut there are another tags which loads assets. The `<object>` works for all browsers except Internet Explorer, which use another cache for `<object>` loaded assets. The Internet Explorer have with `new Image()` an alternative solution. So we combine this two approaches with a small browser detection:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n$(function () {\r\n  var caches = [\r\n    '/path/to/the/asset.css',\r\n    '/path/to/the/asset.js',\r\n  ];\r\n  var isIE = navigator.appName.indexOf('Microsoft') === 0;\r\n  $.each(caches, function (k, cache) {\r\n    if (isIE) {\r\n      new Image().src = cache;\r\n    } else {\r\n      var object = $('<object>').attr({ data: cache, width: 0, height: 0});\r\n      $('body').append(object);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInteresting information in this scenario: `<object>` requests will be blocked by the `X-Frame-Option` header set to `DENY`. The server delivers the assets must not set this header.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nPreloading assets isn't a build in feature of the browsers, but works with workarounds. The solution will speed up the first page view of the subsequent page without affecting the page we use to preload.\r\n\n    ",

Reviewed by: [Golam Mostafa](https://support.themedev.net/author/golap-hazi)\n*   |\n*   September 21, 2023\n*   |\n*   8 minutes\n\nTo enhance website performance, users need to optimize website loading assets for faster page loading is essential. Efficiently managing and compressing loading assets can significantly reduce loading times.\n\nAs well as minimizing CSS and JavaScript files helps optimize website loading speed.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll talk about the importance and facts of optimizing website loading assets. And also we’ll introduce the plugin Next3 Offload to optimize website loading and reduce loading time.\n\nWhy is Website Assets Loading important?\n----------------------------------------\n\nAssets loading optimization is an important practice. It can significantly improve a website’s performance.\n\n**Let’s explore the reasons for optimizing the website **assets**** **loading.**\n\n*   Optimizing website loading assets is crucial for providing a better user experience to visitors.\n*   Faster loading times lead to more enjoyable browsing sessions. It can reduce the likelihood of users leaving the site quickly.\n*   Search engines like Google consider page speed when determining how websites rank in search results.\n*   A website that loads quickly is more likely to appear higher in search listings, potentially attracting more organic traffic.\n*   Studies show that faster-loading websites tend to have higher conversion rates, meaning more users take desired actions like making a purchase or signing up.\n*   This is especially important in an era where many users access websites from mobile devices with varying levels of internet connectivity.\n*   Optimizing loading assets also benefits users with slower internet connections or those in regions with limited bandwidth.\n*   Having a fast-loading website can provide a competitive advantage by setting a brand apart from others in the online space.\n*   It also reduces the strain on servers. It also allows you to handle more traffic without sacrificing performance.\n*   Additionally, a faster-loading site may require fewer server resources.\n\nBest Practices to Optimize Website Loading Assets\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Optimizing Image Assets**\n\nOptimizing Image Assets means strategically reducing image file sizes. It improves the image format of a website without minimizing visual quality.\n\nWeb developers use techniques like compression, resizing, and choosing the right file format. They use them to balance quality visuals and fast loading times.\n\nThis is essential for a smooth user experience. Because faster-loading images leads to quicker page load and potentially boosting search engine rankings.\n\n### **Minimizing JavaScript Execution**\n\nMinimizing JavaScript Execution for WordPress optimization means reducing the amount of JavaScript code.\n\nThis process aims to streamline how JavaScript functions.",

A slow-loading website doesn’t just frustrate users—it costs you engagement, conversions, and credibility. Enter **prefetching** and **preloading**, two often-underappreciated techniques that can elevate your web performance from \"meh\" to \"wow.\"\n\nBut what are these magic tricks, and how can you wield them effectively? Let’s break them down.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](#understanding-prefetching-and-preloading)🎯 Understanding Prefetching and Preloading\n\nAt a high level, both techniques help browsers fetch resources **before** they’re explicitly needed, but their purposes differ:\n\n*   **Prefetching**: Think of it as a browser’s crystal ball. It predicts which resources you might need next (like a linked page) and loads them in the background.\n*   **Preloading**: This focuses on resources needed _right now_ (like fonts, images, or critical scripts) and ensures they’re prioritized during page rendering.\n\nHere’s a simple analogy:\n\n*   Prefetching is like prepping ingredients for tomorrow’s meal.\n*   Preloading is making sure the stove is hot before you start cooking today’s dinner.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](#why-you-should-care)🚀 Why You Should Care\n\nYour site’s performance isn’t just about speed—it’s about the **perception of speed**. Prefetching and preloading make your website feel faster, even when the total load time stays the same.\n\n**Benefits include:**\n\n*   Faster navigation and rendering.\n*   Reduced latency for future interactions.\n*   Improved user experience, especially on slower networks.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](#how-to-implement-prefetching)🔧 How to Implement Prefetching\n\nPrefetching is all about anticipating user behavior. You can use it to pre-load assets like the next page’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n**Basic Example**  \n\n    <link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"next-page.html\">\n    \n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n*   The browser fetches `next-page.html` in the background.\n*   When the user clicks the link, the page is loaded almost instantly.\n\n**Pro Tips for Prefetching**\n\n*   **Focus on High-Probability Actions**: Use analytics to predict the user’s next step. For instance, e-commerce sites can prefetch product details after users browse categories.\n*   **Use `rel=\"prerender\"` for Entire Pages**: When confident, use prerendering to fully load the next page in a hidden tab.\n\n       <link rel=\"prerender\" href=\"checkout.html\">\n    \n\n*   **Avoid Overloading the Network**: Fetching too many resources can hurt overall performance.\n\n* * *\n\n### [](#mastering-preloading)🔥 Mastering Preloading\n\nPreloading helps you prioritize **essential resources** for the current page.\n\n**Basic Example**  \n\n    <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"styles.css\" as=\"style\">\n    \n\nThe `as` attribute specifies the type of resource (e.g., `style`, `script`, `font`), so the browser can handle it ef",

Simply telling the browser to fetch information in the background can drastically reduce loading times.\n\nA web page is more than just HTML. It includes scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and pictures. Some resources are on your server, while others come from third-party sources. The browser fetches and converts these resources into a working page during loading, requiring many connections. Resource directives help the browser start and perform tasks in parallel to save time.\n\nWhat are Prefetching, Preloading, and Prerendering?\n-----------------------",

For example, to preload a stylesheet, you could use the following code:\n\n    <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/path/to/stylesheet.css\" as=\"style\">\n\nThis tells the browser to start loading the stylesheet as soon as possible, even if it is not needed immediately. The `as` attribute specifies the type of resource preloaded, in this case, a stylesheet.\n\nPrefetching\n-----------\n\nPrefetching is similar to preloading but is used for resources that are not immediately required but are likely to be needed in the future.\n\nFor example, if you have a page with links to several other pages, you might want to prefetch the resources required for those pages to be available when the user navigates to them.\n\nTo prefetch a resource, you can use the `<link>` element in the same way as for preloading. For example, to prefetch a JavaScript file, you could use the following code:\n\n    <link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"/path/to/script.js\">\n\nThis tells the browser to start loading the JavaScript file as soon as possible, even if it is not needed immediately.\n\nService Workers\n---------------\n\nService workers are a type of web worker that can be used to improve the loading performance of a web application.\n\nService workers run in the background, separate from the main JavaScript thread, and can be used to cache resources, intercept network requests, and handle offline functionality.\n\nTo use a service worker, you first need to register it in your application. This can be done by calling the `navigator.serviceWorker.register()` method and passing in the path to the service worker script file.\n\nFor example:\n\n    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/path/to/service-worker.js');\n\nOnce the service worker is registered, it will be installed and activated. The service worker can then intercept network requests and handle them as needed.\n\nFor example, it could cache resources, allowing the application to work offline, or it could serve resources from the cache instead of making a network request.\n\nTo cache resources with a service worker, you can use the `**[caches.open()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/open)**` method, passing in a **cache name** and a **list of resources to cache**. For example:\n\n    caches.open('cache-name').then(function(cache) {\n      cache.addAll([\n        '/path/to/resource1.html',\n        '/path/to/resource2.css'\n      ]);\n    });\n\nYou can use the `fetch` event to intercept network requ",

Preloading allows developers to specify which resources should be loaded early in the page life cycle, even before the browser's rendering engine needs them. This process can significantly enhance user experience by reducing load times and ensuring that important content is displayed without delay. The article discusses how to implement preloading using link rel='preload' tags, the types of assets that benefit most from preloading, and how it interacts with browser caching mechanisms. Additionally, it explores best practices for using preloading effectively without overburdening the network or delaying the loading of other critical resources. The integration of preloading strategies with LoadFocus tools to monitor and optimize website performance is also highlighted, providing readers with practical insights into leveraging preloading for improved web speed and reliability.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

TTFB, FCP, LCP, FID, INP, CLS...](/en/post/all-the-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know/)\n\npublish date: 2025-02-15\n\nLast updated: View update history\n\nIntroduction[](#introduction)\n-----------------------------\n\nDuring a previous interview, I was asked about a SPA I created and its poor image loading experience when changing pages. I shared all my thoughts, which I wasn’t very confident about 😅. My answers included:\n\n*   Images should have width and height set to avoid [CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)🔗](https://www.webdong.dev/en/post/all-the-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know/#cls---cumulative-layout-shift-)\n*   Images can add Skeleton or Loader to indicate loading\n*   Initially display smaller images, then replace them with the actual larger images at the right time\n*   Images can use `fetchpriority` to arrange resource loading priority\n*   Inline SVG or data URI can be used for images\n*   Use Preload to pre-load critical images…?\n\nThis time, I aim to clarify the mechanisms provided by browsers in this regard, mainly introducing how browsers handle resource loading. The `<head>` section is typically where HTML loads resources, and the `<link>` tag has a special `rel` attribute to indicate how external resources should be loaded.\n\nProblem: Timing of Loading Order[](#problem-timing-of-loading-order)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWeb page images only load when the page is loaded, so when changing pages, some key images not appearing can seem very odd. Aside from directly embedding resources, is there a way to **change the resource loading order of the page** to improve user experience?\n\nUnderstanding `rel=\"preload\"`[](#understanding-relpreload)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis allows you to declare requests for data to be fetched when the page loads, typically for data that you want to load immediately early in the page load:\n\n*   Resources pointed to by CSS, such as fonts or images\n*   Resources requested by JavaScript, such as JSON\n*   Various large resources\n*   ……\n\nFor example, when using Google Fonts, you receive a CSS file containing all the `@font-face` rules pointing to the download locations of the fonts. This way, you don’t have to load the entire font package at once; the browser compares the text appearing on the page with the `unicode-range` in this file and downloads the corresponding font subset file:\n\n    /* latin */@font-face {  font-family: 'Lato';  font-style: normal;  font-weight: 400;  font-display: swap;  src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/lato/v24/S6uyw4BMUTPHjx4wXg.woff2) format('woff2');  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+0304, U+0308, U+0329,    U+2000-206F, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;}\n\nIf you want to “pre-download specific resources,” you can specify `preload` and type `as=\"font\"` to have specific font files downloaded in advance.\n\n    <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/lato/v24/S6uyw4BMUTPHjx4wXg.woff2\" as=\"font\" crossorigin />\n\nOther types of Preload examples:\n\n    <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/style/other.css\" as=\"style\" /><link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/assets/font.woff2\" as=\"font\" /><link rel=\"preload\" href=\"/img/header.png\" as=\"image\" />\n\nUnderstanding `r",
