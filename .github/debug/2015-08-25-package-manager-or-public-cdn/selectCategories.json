I will describe two of them and a solution to combine both to have most of the advantages.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## Package Manager\r\n\r\nA package manager like Bower can be used to load all dependencies (and the dependencies of the dependencies) during the build time.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n\r\n* The dependencies are not checked in under the version control, only the list which dependencies in which version\r\n* Wildcard version numbers can be used to get automatically new minor or patch versions\r\n* The package manager does the lookup for the compatible dependencies of the dependencies and load them\r\n\r\nBut there is a large disadvantage. All the dependencies will be hosted by your own. The first page view will be slow, the browser must download all dependencies. If the dependencies are bundled with the own JavaScript the browser needs only load one file, but can't cache them separately.\r\n\r\n## Public CDN\r\n\r\nUsing public CDN means load the third party JavaScript and CSS with the HTML tags (script and link) from a host which is used by many other websites.  The important advantages is: the chance common libraries are already cached is high and the browser doesn't need to load them.\r\n\r\nBut there are a few disadvantages:\r\n\r\n* The version number is defined in the URL for the assets. So hardcode the URL means hardcode the used versions\r\n* Loading JavaScript with HTML tags means not able to use CommonJS modules\r\n\r\n## Combine the two approaches\r\n\r\nFor widely used libraries with available public CDN its possible to combine the two approaches: Use public CDN URLs but with a variable version number filled in by a package manager.\r\n\r\n1. Define the list of the dependencies and their versions for the package manager:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dependencies\": {\r\n        \"jquery\": \"^2.1.3\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Define the URL to the public CDN with a placeholder for the version number:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/{{ bower.jquery }}/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Read the version from the local library loaded with the package manager (e.g. /bower_components/jquery/.bower.json) and fill the placeholder with it:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the third party libraries will always be loaded from the public CDN URLs in the version which is currently chosen by the package manager.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe combination gives the most advantages of both approaches. The package manager cares about the actual used versions and the public CDN speeds up the first page view.\r\n\r\nBut it needs a bit of rethinking how to work with third party libraries without using their CommonJS modules.\r\n\r\nAt the end its a tradeoff: Get the speed and the overview of using CommonJS modules only for the own code against the possibility to use different versions of the same library which is allowed in a complete CommonJS environment.\r\n\n    ",

Bower manages all these things for you.\n\nKeeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) is tricky. Bower to the rescue!\n\nBower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.\n\nTo [get started](#getting-started), Bower works by fetching and installing [packages](/search) from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you’re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, [`bower.json`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson). How you use [packages](/search) is up to you. Bower provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your [tools and workflows](/docs/tools).\n\nBower is optimized for the front-end. If multiple packages depend on a package - jQuery for example - Bower will download jQuery just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load.\n\nInstall Bower\n-------------\n\nBower is a command line utility. Install it with npm.\n\n    $ npm install -g bower\n\nBower requires [node, npm](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.org).\n\nLatest release:\n\nFor troubleshooting installation on different platforms, read the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/bower/bower/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki page.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n### Install packages\n\nInstall packages with [`bower install`](/docs/api#install). Bower installs packages to `bower_components/`.\n\n    $ bower install <package>\n\nA package can be a GitHub shorthand, a Git endpoint, a URL, and more. Read more about [`bower install`](/docs/api/#install).\n\n    # installs the project dependencies listed in bower.json\n    $ bower install\n    # registered package\n    $ bower install jquery\n    # GitHub shorthand\n    $ bower install desandro/masonry\n    # Git endpoint\n    $ bower install git://github.com/user/package.git\n    # URL\n    $ bower install http://example.com/script.js\n\n### Search packages\n\n[Search Bower packages](/search) and find the registered package names for your favorite projects.\n\n### Save packages\n\nCreate a `bower.json` file for your package with [`bower init`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson).\n\nThen save new dependencies to your `bower.json` with `bower install PACKAGE --save`\n\n### Use packages\n\nHow you use packages is up to you. We recommend you use Bower together with [Grunt, RequireJS, Yeoman, and lots of other tools](/docs/tools/) or build your own workflow with [the API](/docs/api/). You can also use the installed packages directly, like this, in the case of `jquery`:\n\n    <script src=\"bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\nTwitter updates from [@bower](https://twitter.com/bower)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Tweets by bower](https://twitter.com/bower?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Help improve these docs.

For server-side JavaScript there is npm (reasons why it's not suitable for client-side are below), but client-side JavaScript until recently didn't have anything. There were many different package managers (Jam, Component, Volo, Ender), but the majority of them never became popular, and there is little sense in package managers that can't install the right packages.\n\nBower is not the standard package manager for client-side JavaScript, but the most popular one: currently there are more than sixteen thousand packages.\n\nBower doesn't prescribe to the user its own build system, or to the developer a method of including libraries (AMD, CommonJS, etc.) All Bower does is install the right versions of the packages that the project needs and their dependencies. In other words: it downloads source files for the right libraries and everything they need into a special folder. Everything else is up to the developer.\n\n[Why Not npm](#why-not-npm)\n---------------------------\n\nThe main difference between npm and Bower is the approach for installing package dependencies. npm installs dependencies for each package separately, and as a result makes a big package dependency tree (`node_modules/grunt/node_modules/glob/node_modules/...`), where there could be several version of the same package. For client-side JavaScript this is unacceptable: you can't add two different version for jQuery or any other library to a page. With Bower each package is installed once (jQuery will always be in the `bower_components/jquery` folder, regardless of how many packages depend on it) and in the case of a dependency conflict, Bower simply won't install the package incompatible with one that's already installed.\n\n[Installing Bower](#installing-bower)\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo work with Bower you'll need Node.js and git. Installation:\n\n    > npm install -g bower\n\n[Working with Packages](#working-with-packages)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nLet's try to install something, for example jQuery:\n\n    > bower install --save jquery  # or bower i -S jquery\n\nThis command will download the latest version of jQuery into the `bower_components/jquery` folder.\n\nThe `--save` flag tells Bower that it should save the package name and its version into the `bower.json` manifest file. In this file is a list of all dependencies of the project (packages installed with Bower) and other metadata required for creation of your own packages (more on this at the end of the article). With the package names it's possible to specify the version with which your project is guaranteed to work.\n\nWe don't have a file like that yet, which is what the line \"No bower.json file to save to, use bower init to create one\" in the log is about. Let's create it:\n\n    > bower init\n\nBower will ask many questions, but until we want to register our package, answers to most of them don't matter, you can just press Enter.\n\nThe question \"set currently installed components as dependencies?\" should be answered with \"yes\" — all previously installed components (in our case it's jQuery) will be automatically placed in the created JSON file. The question \"would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry?\" should also be answered \"yes\" — this will prevent accidental publication of the package into the Bower registry.\n\nLet's install a few more packages:\n\n    > bower install --save social-likes jquery-icheck fotorama\n\nAnd take a look at what we got:\n\n    > bower list\n    bower check-new     Checking for new versions of the project dependencies..\n    bowertest#0.0.0 /Users/admin/bowertest\n    ├─┬ fotorama#4.5.1\n    │ └── jquery#2.1.0 (2.1.1-beta1 available)\n    ├── jquery#2.1.0 (2.1.1-beta1 available)\n    ├─┬ jquery-icheck#1.0.2\n    │ └── jquery#2.1.0 (2.1.1-beta1 available)\n    └─┬ social-likes#3.0.2\n        └── jquery#2.1.0\n\nThe `bower list` command shows a list of all installed packages. Here we see that all packages depend on jQuery, and that Bower found a version suitable for them all: 2.1.0.\n\nIn the file system it looks like this:\n\n    >",

Bower and npm are two popular package managers that serve different purposes but can complement each other. Bower is ideal for managing frontend dependencies, while npm handles both frontend and backend dependencies. By integrating both package managers, developers can streamline their project setup and management.\n\n### Setting Up Bower and npm [#](#setting-up-bower-and-npm)\n\nFirst, ensure you have both Bower and npm installed globally. Run the following commands in your terminal:\n\n    npm install -g bower\n    bower init\n\n### Installing Dependencies with npm [#](#installing-dependencies-with-npm)\n\nFor backend dependencies, we use npm. Let's create a simple project that depends on the `express` framework. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal:\n\n    npm init -y\n    npm install express\n\n### Installing Frontend Dependencies with Bower [#](#installing-frontend-dependencies-with-bower)\n\nNow, let's create a simple frontend dependency using Bower. Create a new directory for your frontend project and install a popular CSS framework, Bootstrap, using Bower:\n\n    cd frontend\n    bower init\n    bower install bootstrap#3.3.7\n\n### Integrating Bower and npm Dependencies [#](#integrating-bower-and-npm-dependencies)\n\nTo integrate frontend and backend dependencies, we can use npm scripts. Create a new file named `package.json` in your project directory with the following content:\n\n    {\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"node server.js\",\n        \"build\": \"gulp\"\n      },\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"gulp\": \"^4.0.2\",\n        \"gulp-bower-files\": \"^0.3.1\"\n      }\n    }\n\n### Running Your Application [#](#running-your-application)\n\nTo run your application, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n    npm start\n\nThis command will start your Express server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.\n\n### Building Your Project [#](#building-your-project)\n\nTo build your project, use the following command:\n\n    npm run build\n\nThis command will execute the `gulp` task, which is responsible for copying the Bower dependencies to your project directory.\n\n### Final Thoughts [#](#final-thoughts)\n\nBy integrating Bower and npm, you can efficiently manage your frontend and backend dependencies. Remember to use Bower for frontend dependencies and npm for both frontend and backend dependencies. Use npm scripts to integrate the frontend build process into your project. With this setup, you'll have a streamlined project management workflow that's efficient and easy to maintain.\n\n*   Previous: [Bower and ES6 modules: A guide to integrating modern front-end dependencies](/blog/bower_and_es6_modules_a_guide_to_integrating_modern_frontend_dependencies/)\n*   Next: [Bower and the future of front-end package management: Trends and alternatives](/blog/bower_and_the_future_of_frontend_package_management_trends_and_alternatives/)",

Bower manages all these things for you.\n\nKeeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) is tricky. Bower to the rescue!\n\nBower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.\n\nTo [get started](#getting-started), Bower works by fetching and installing [packages](/search) from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you’re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, [`bower.json`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson). How you use [packages](/search) is up to you. Bower provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your [tools and workflows](/docs/tools).\n\nBower is optimized for the front-end. If multiple packages depend on a package - jQuery for example - Bower will download jQuery just once. This is known as a flat dependency graph and it helps reduce page load.\n\nInstall Bower\n-------------\n\nBower is a command line utility. Install it with npm.\n\n    $ npm install -g bower\n\nBower requires [node, npm](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.org).\n\nLatest release:\n\nFor troubleshooting installation on different platforms, read the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/bower/bower/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki page.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n### Install packages\n\nInstall packages with [`bower install`](/docs/api#install). Bower installs packages to `bower_components/`.\n\n    $ bower install <package>\n\nA package can be a GitHub shorthand, a Git endpoint, a URL, and more. Read more about [`bower install`](/docs/api/#install).\n\n    # installs the project dependencies listed in bower.json\n    $ bower install\n    # registered package\n    $ bower install jquery\n    # GitHub shorthand\n    $ bower install desandro/masonry\n    # Git endpoint\n    $ bower install git://github.com/user/package.git\n    # URL\n    $ bower install http://example.com/script.js\n\n### Search packages\n\n[Search Bower packages](/search) and find the registered package names for your favorite projects.\n\n### Save packages\n\nCreate a `bower.json` file for your package with [`bower init`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson).\n\nThen save new dependencies to your `bower.json` with `bower install PACKAGE --save`\n\n### Use packages\n\nHow you use packages is up to you. We recommend you use Bower together with [Grunt, RequireJS, Yeoman, and lots of other tools](/docs/tools/) or build your own workflow with [the API](/docs/api/). You can also use the installed packages directly, like this, in the case of `jquery`:\n\n    <script src=\"bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n\nTwitter updates from [@bower](https://twitter.com/bower)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Tweets by bower](https://twitter.com/bower?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Help improve these docs.
