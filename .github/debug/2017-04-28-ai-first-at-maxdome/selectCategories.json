AI here means **the way an user interact with a service**: Not with a mobile app or a website, but **with its own natural written or spoken language**. Understanding natural language is an own and very complex topic, so it's good Alexa and Google Assistent do this for us and we focus on linking our business logic to that platforms.\n\n## General Workflow\n\n![General Workflow](/assets/2017-04-28-ai-first-at-maxdome/images/general-workflow.png)\n\n1. An user write/say something\n2. The platform (Alexa or Google Assistent) interpret it with the help of some sample utterances to an intent\n3. Our business service gets a request with the intent and response with an answer\n\nSo what's our part in this workflow? a) Providing the names of the intents together with sample utterances we want to support and b) an API for the request response.\n\n## Build an action\n\n### a) Prepare the platform\n\nI don't give this part to much focus in this post, because its already well documented for both platforms [Alexa (ignore Step#2)](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/TxDJWS16KUPVKO/New-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Template:-Build-a-Trivia-Skill-in-under-an-Hour) and [Google Assistent](https://console.api.ai/api-client/#/getStarted).\n\n### b) API for the business service\n\n#### Step 1: PoC for Alexa\n\nThe first thoughts was \"keep it simple, just start with a PoC for Alexa\". So we prepared the alexa platform and built a RestAPI with our business logic understanding and responding in the [Alexa JSON format](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference). We made a few skills (see [dalexa-maxdome](https://github.com/dragonprojects/dalexa-maxdome)) to try out the different topics: a very basic one, a skill with slots, sessions, pagination and at the end account linking with OAuth 2.0.    \n\nOur learnings:\n\n* It worked!\n* It's really easy and streight forward because its just getting and responding JSON\n* OAuth 2.0 is cool\n* A \"Show a comedy\" and the TV starts would be nice, but need a lot more effort than we wanted to spend for a PoC\n* All of the things worked without changing existing services, new microservice(s) for new features rocks\n* The most difficult part was \"what's the minimum information does an user need for an asset to know if its interesting\". Only the title is not enough, if it's not a well known blockbuster and the description is most times to long. Later in the week, this becomes an own NPM package (see [ai-renderer-maxdome](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-renderer-maxdome))\n\n#### Step 2: Think about abstraction\n\nA bit later a Google Home stand on our desktop and of course we wanted to play with it and try out our PoC on that device too.\nWe thought about support it streight forward by bulding a new microservice with our business logic from scratch understanding and responding in the [Google Assistant JSON format](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/webhook-format).\nBut we decided to spend a bit more time and build an abstraction layer to make the business logic independ of the supported platform.\n\n![Abstracted Workflow](/assets/2017-04-28-ai-first-at-maxdome/images/abstracted-workflow.png)\n\nLike you can see in the diagram, we built \"connectors\" (see [ai-connector-alexa](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-connector-alexa) and [ai-connector-apiai](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-connector-apiai)) which transforms the platform specific JSON formats to an internal used format for the business logic named \"webhook\" (see [ai-webhook-maxdome](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-webhook-maxdome)). And also the OAuth 2.0 integration got an own service named \"oauth\" (see [ai-oauth-maxdome](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-oauth-maxdome)), luckily both platforms supporting the same account linking concept.\n\nOur learnings:\n\n* It worked!\n* New features can independently built in the \"webhook\" and later supported by the \"connectors\"\n* New \"connectors\" allow to adopt new platforms very fast and easy\n* All the services are very small and easy to test\n\n## Our next steps?\n\n* Let us care about our core business: Streaming, start playing movies on a TV by our voice\n* Adopt other platforms with new connectors like Cortana, Siri and bixby. But also non voice platforms like Facebook Messenger and Skype\n\n## Bonus: Alexa's \"Tägliche Zusammenfassung\" - Flash Briefing Skill API\n\nIn Alexa it's possible to choose services which you think are interesting for a daily summary. Then you can just say \"Alexa, was gibt es neues\" and get for all choosen services the news.\nThis feature is not like a custom skill where we get a JSON request, it's simply a RSS or JSON feed.\nAlso for this we made a PoC for maxdome (see [ai-flashbriefing-maxdome](https://github.com/dragonprojects/ai-flashbriefing-maxdome)).\n\nLater in the week: The PoC grew up and [\"maxdome - Tipp des Tages\"](https://www.amazon.de/maxdome-GmbH-Tipp-des-Tages/dp/B06ZYMH963/) is the first published skill in the \"Film & Fernsehen\" section with the \"Tägliche Zusammenfassung\" feature, yeah. :)\n\nAlso [ai-flashbriefing-maxdome](https://github.com/maxdome/ai-flashbriefing-maxdome) and the [deployed service](http://ai-flashbriefing-maxdome-prod.a4z2vg6thb.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) moved to the company.\n\n## Summary\n\nAI first is a very wide topic. But with a small managable effort we got a lot of insights to decide if, when and with which scope we want to jump deeper. And in addition the first AI product of us can go live: The \"Tägliche Zusammenfassung\" for Alexa.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why an abstraction layer, API.ai already have Alexa integration?\nYes, but the Alexa integration is only an export of the intent schema and the sample utterances. The webhook which gets the request must still works for both JSON formats and responding in the platform specific format.\n\n### Why spend time into this topic, it doesn't have business value?\nYes, currently we wouldn't sell something over this platforms or generate many new subs. But if Google's vision become true, AI first will be as important as todays \"Mobile first\" and for our product a must have part. So it's worth to start getting familiar with it.\n\nLater in the week, Amazon and Google push this topic very hard:\n\n* [The new FireTV Stick gets Alexa](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Amazons-neuer-Fire-TV-Stick-in-Deutschland-Quadcore-Prozessor-und-Sprachassistentin-Alexa-3631507.html)\n* [Many Android smartphones gets Google Assistant](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Google-liefert-seinen-Assistenten-fuer-die-Allgemeinheit-aus-3635423.html)\n\nSo maybe this topic becomes faster as assumed important for all companies.\n\n    ",

There are loads of voice AI platforms, so picking the best ohone can be tough. That’s why I tested these platforms, tried the features, and ranked each one to make your life easier. \n\n**My top platforms** are Alexa for home use and smart home devices, Siri for iOS users, and Otter AI for executing business-related tasks, such as taking meeting notes.   \n\n**Read on to learn more about:**\n\n*   How I chose my top 24 voice AI assistants\n*   Review of features and pricing of the top 24 AI voice assistants\n*   Why you should pick [Lindy.ai](http://lindy.ai) as your AI platform\n\nHow I chose the best AI voice assistants\n----------------------------------------\n\nFirst, I found loads of different AI voice assistant platforms, and boiled down my shortlist to 24 by _actually_ **testing them against these standards:** \n\n*   **Accuracy and responsiveness:** I assessed how well the voice assistants understood and responded to various commands and queries. Then, I measured how quickly each assistant processed requests and delivered results. In my opinion, a high-performing AI voice assistant understands precisely what is being asked and responds instantly.\n*   **Integration and compatibility:** I examined how these assistants could be integrated with everyday devices. This ensured that each assistant could work across different operating systems without reconfiguration. I found that this ability is crucial for a voice assistant’s functionality and flexibility, as device ty",

In this article, we will examine and compare the top AI voice assistants to help you decide which one deserves to take the crown as the reigning champion.\n\nIn this guide, you will find the central question: who is the best assistant?\n\nThe Science of Speech: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at How AI Voice Assistants Work\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are designed to understand and respond to your voice commands.\n\nWhen you speak to a voice assistant, it records your voice and analyzes it using a special algorithm. This algorithm breaks down your speech into individual sounds and matches them with words and phrases that are most likely to be what you meant to say.\n\nAfter the voice assistant understands what you said, it generates a response that is tailored to your query. For example, if you ask “What’s the weather like today?”, the voice assistant will analyze your query and generate a response, such as “It’s currently 70 degrees and sunny outside.”\n\nTo generate responses, voice assistants use natural language generation techniques. This means that the algorithm analyzes the meaning of your query and generates a response in natural language that sounds like it was written by a human.\n\nVoice assistants have come a long way and are now able to understand a variety of accents and dialects. However, they can still struggle with background noise or unclear speech. Overall, AI voice assistants are designed to make our lives easier by allowing us to perform tasks hands-free using voice commands.\n\nFind Your Voice: The Top AI Voice Assistants to Simplify Your Life\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Siri\n\nSiri is a voice assistant developed by Apple, first introduced in 2011 as a feature of the iPhone 4S. It was one of the first mainstream voice assistants and has since become a widely recognized brand in the field of AI voice technology.\n\n#### Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nSiri’s strength lies in its integration with Apple’s ecosystem, allowing users to seamlessly interact with their devices through voice commands. It also boasts a wide range of features, including the ability to make phone calls, send messages, set reminders, and access information on demand. In addition, Siri can control smart home devices and interact with third-party apps, providing a wide range of functionality to users.\n\nHowever, Siri has also faced criticism for its accuracy and responsiveness. Compared to other voice assistants, Siri is often considered less reliable in understanding and executing complex commands. It also lacks some of the advanced features and customization options offered by its competitors.\n\n#### User experience and features\n\nIn terms of user experience, Siri is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a conversational interface that responds to natural language commands. It also features a variety of voices and accents to choose from, as well as the ability to customize the wake word (the phrase that activates the assistant).\n\n#### Comparison\n\nWhen compared to other voice assistants, Siri performs well in terms of integration with Apple devices and services, but falls short in terms of overall accuracy and responsiveness. Competitors such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa offer more advanced features and customization options, as well as a wider range of integrations with third-party services and devices.\n\nOverall, Siri remains a popular choice for users who are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, but may not ",

We already have guides for these:\n\n*   [Amazon Alexa: Everything About Amazon’s Voice-Controlled Assistant](https://biglysales.com/amazon-alexa-amazons-voice-controlled-assistant/)\n*   [Google Assistant: All About AI Voice Assistant](https://biglysales.com/google-assistant-all-about-ai-voice-assistant/)\n\nWe’ll now look into the key differences between Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant:\n\n### **AI Intelligence & Natural Language Processing**\n\nThe first comparison element includes AI and NLP:\n\n#### **Alexa**\n\n*   Its improved context memory allows it to continue conversations naturally.\n*   It has tight integration with Amazon’s shopping and home automation ecosystem.\n*   It’s equipped with enhanced voice customization options for a more natural interaction.\n\n#### **Google Assistant**\n\n*   This intelligent voice assistant naturally understands and processes complex queries.\n*   It handles follow-up questions seamlessly, creating a conversation-like experience.\n*   Its predictive capabilities make proactive suggestions based on your routines.\n\nSimply speaking, Google Assistant leads those valuing advanced AI intelligence and seamless conversations. On the other hand, Alexa remains a strong contender for better smart home and shopping integration.\n\n### **Smart Home Control & Device Compatibility**\n\nEverything is getting smarter. So why not your homes? The following comparison is about smart home control and device compatibility:\n\n#### **Alexa**\n\n*   It’s compatible with over 140,000 smart devices, making it the most widely supported voice assistant.\n*   It has advanced Routines that allow for multi-device automation in ways Google still lags.\n*   It works seamlessly with Ring, Eero, and various third-party IoT devices.\n\n#### **Google Assistant**\n\n*   It has increased support for Matter and Thread, broadening smart home compatibility.\n*   It has smarter automation suggestions based on your behavioral patterns.\n*   It also has deep integration with the Google Nest ecosystem.\n\nWhile Google Assistant’s AI-driven automation is improving rapidly, Alexa still leads in smart home compatibility.\n\n### **Entertainment & Media Streaming**\n\nNow comes how the two voice assistants interact with entertainment and media streaming:\n\n#### **Alexa**\n\n*   It works best with Amazon Music, Spotify, and Apple Music.\n*   Fire TV integration allows complete voice control over streaming.\n*   It lacks deep YouTube integration, which is a major drawback.\n\n#### **Google Assistant**\n\n*   It has native support for YouTube Music, YouTube, and Chromecast.\n*   Google TV integration allows complete media control with voice commands.\n*   It works seamlessly with Spotify, Netflix, and more.\n\nGoogle Assistant is a better choice for YouTube and Chromecast, while Alexa is a winner if you’ve fully invested in Amazon’s ecosystem.\n\n### **Privacy & Security**\n\nPrivacy and",
